This is a proposed solution to the Way2B1 onsite interview challenge built off of a [personally customized version](https://github.com/taygrave/starter_template) of [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot), which is a comprehensive starter kit for rapid application development using React/Redux.

## Requirements
1. Make an input that subsequently calls an endpoint to get GitHub user & repo data.
2. Display the repos and the user's avatar.
3. BONUS: Have a second input to filter the repo search.

## Running Locally
- **Clone the project**: `git clone git@github.com:taygrave/w2b1_challenge.git`
- **Install packages**: `npm i`
- **Run the example app**: `npm start`
- **Go!** Input a user's github name and click the button!
